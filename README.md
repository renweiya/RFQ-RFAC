Represented Value Function Approach for Large Scale Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning

A Tensorflow implementation of RFAC and RFQ in the paper [Represented Value Function Approach for Large Scale Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01096v1).

 This work is based on the code framework in [MFQ-MFAC](https://github.com/mlii/mfrl.git)

## Code structure

- `./examples/`: contains scenarios for Game and models.
- `battle.py`: contains code for running Battle Game with trained model
- `wild_war.py`: contains code for running Wild war Game with trained model
- `train_battle.py`: contains code for training Battle Game models
- `wildwar_ELO_single.py`: contains code for testing Wild war game by Elo Scores among all players
- `battle_ELO_single`: contains code for testing Battle game by Elo Scores among all players
- `data`: pre-trained model
## Compile Ising environment and run

**Requirements**
- `python>=3.6.0`
- `tensorflow>=1.14.0`

## Compile MAgent platform and run

Before running Battle Game environment, you need to compile it. You can get more helps from: [MAgent](https://github.com/geek-ai/MAgent) 

**Steps for compiling**

  1. `cd Represented_Value Function_MARL/examples/battle_model`

  2. `bash build.sh`

**Steps for training models under Battle Game settings**

1. cd Represented_Value Function_MARL

   `export PYTHONPATH=./examples/battle_model/python:${PYTHONPATH}`

2. Run training script for training (e.g. rfac):

   `python train_battle.py --algo rfac`

3. train your model and change the name of model file from 1999 to 1999A,1999B,...

**Steps for testing models under Battle Game and Wild_war Game**

1. Battle Game

   `python battle.py --algo mfq --oppo rfac --idx {1999A,1999A}`

2. Wild war Game

   `python wild_war.py --algo mfq --oppo rfac --idx {1999A,1999A}`

3. Compute Elo scores

   `python battle_ELO_single.py`

   `python wildwar_ELO_single.py`

7. once you open a terminal,type:

   `export PYTHONPATH=./examples/battle_model/python:${PYTHONPATH}`

   or you can edit the ~/.bashrc file to save time.
